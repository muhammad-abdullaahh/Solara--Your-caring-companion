# Solara – AI Chatbot Web App

Solara is a lightweight, browser-based AI chatbot interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project focuses on a clean UI, smooth interaction, and simple API-style messaging — perfect for beginners who want to understand how chat interfaces work.

> **Note:** Solara is *just a chatbot UI*. It does not contain or connect to any real AI backend unless you integrate one.
